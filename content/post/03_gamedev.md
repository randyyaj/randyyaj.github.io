A game I made for the Global Game Jam Event. The theme was Ritual. All I could think about was Shamans and voodoo magic and sacrificial rituals so I decided to make an endless runner where the player is a goat and has to escape the shamans.

The other idea I had was a person who was totally OCD and has to do these rituals like turn a door knob 5 times or sort things in order.

The software I used was Godot Engine, Inkscape, Spriter2D.
You can find the game located here
