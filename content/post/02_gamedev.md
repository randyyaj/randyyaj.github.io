A game I made for ludumDare33. Theme you are the monster. In this game you are a squid like creature that shits ink on humanity.
The objective is to prevent the humans from bunking. I didn't finish on time but the game is playable and funny. 

Software I used was Godot Engine, Inkscape, and Spriter. Click on the image to access the site and downloads.
