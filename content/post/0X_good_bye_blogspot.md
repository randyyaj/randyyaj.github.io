## Goodbye blogspot. Hello Hugo!

I doubt it but if anybody reading this now has ever looked at my blog over at randyyaj.blogspot.com. It has come to an end... Oh fair well thee.
I switched to a static site generator because I wanted a little more control of my contents and structure of my pages and also these static site generators
are pretty nice with their markdown and all.

I looked at a few other options too such as jekyll, hexo, and pelican but ultimately ended up using hugo. At first I was hesitant at using hugo since I have never touched the go language before but that wasn't the case here. Hugo was super easy to setup and fast too. Was able to get it up and running following the quick-start guide with barely any go lang knowledge.

So what's going to happen to my blogspot? Well it'll still be there and the contents will still be able to download but all of my future posts will exist here now.
