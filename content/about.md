### Welcome Reader!

Chances are you stumbled here by accident. But if you didn't carry on reading my boring about me section.

My name is Randy yang. I am a enthusiastic person who loves making games and art, open source projects, 
writing useless programs, solving puzzles, blogging, and eating food!
This is my personal blog which includes all my thoughts, work, and tutorials. 
If you like to contact me for work please reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/randy-yang/2b/835/713) 
otherwise hope you enjoy this site!

How did I become a software engineer? Lots of reading and even more coffee.
